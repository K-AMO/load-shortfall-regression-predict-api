Black Belt

We are a consulting firm that has been approached by the government of Spain to aid them in their electricity crisis by building a regression model that will help them predict the load shortfall and build an API using the Amazon EC instance. This model will be built based on renewable resources data.

We spent a month working through various regression models and selected the models that gave us the best predictions.
